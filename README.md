This is a file to keep track of my progress in VisionX task 2 of the InternShip.
We were given 6 days to learn Modern JavaScript and implement es6 based concepts
on a task given to acess our learning.
Work Started on 19 Nov On thursday Evening by creating a file structure and pushing it to git.
20 Nov work completed 50%
got feedback
-Remove console logs
-I must use es6, and even if I don't I should use I should stick with one approach either es6 or tradition JS.
-I should revise my approaches and avoid jugaarS(hacks).
-Local storage should only have 1 Item stored (movies)
-findIndex function should be replaced
I have taken into account all the feed back and implented it except not using the findIndex function.
